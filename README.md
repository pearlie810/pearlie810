Hi, my fellow website readers!

Thanks for taking the time to visit my GitHub. Let's start with a quick introduction about me and this little corner of the internet!

I'm Anne, a multi-disciplinary designer based in Toronto, Canada. My Vietnamese name is 'Minh Ngọc' which means 'brilliant gemstone' or 'brilliant pearl' hence the username 'pearlie'.

This website (pearlie.net) is where I'm documenting parts of my life as a 20-something-year-old figuring life out one step at a time ✦

Lots of love,
Anne
